# Gesture-Based-Musical-Instrument
The Gesture-Based Musical Instrument is a touchless music system that uses computer vision to convert hand movements into real-time sound. With a webcam and libraries like OpenCV and MediaPipe, it tracks hand landmarks and recognizes gestures to play instruments such as piano, guitar, drums, flute, and more.
